If necessary, provide a very brief description of the dish in one or two sentences.
For most dishes, this will be unnecessary.
If there is a title image of this dish, it should be above this paragraph.
You may also include prepcook time and the number of servings as below

- ⏲️ Prep time 10 min
- 🍳 Cook time 30 min
- 🍽️ Servings 4

## Ingredients

- There must be a blank line above all lists.
- List the ingredients
- in an unordered list
- similar to this.
- List amounts if necessary.
- Put (optional) at the end of optional ingredients

## Directions

1. Now using an ordered list,
2. give the directions to prepare the dish.
3. Do not add unnecessary blank lines between items.
4. If necessary,
5. an image can be included between some directions if needed to explain something particular.
6. But that should be kept to a minimum to reduce bandwidth and aid in simplicity.

Note that you can create a `your-name.json` file in `dataauthors` to add
personal links and donation addresses if you want more specific credit. If you
do this, for the `author` line the in the metadata, include the bare file name
of the json file. For example, my file is `dataauthorsluke-smith.json`, so I
would put `author luke-smith`.

A swiss favorite, _Älplermagronen_ combines pretty much everything you have at your disposal in your alpine chalet.
It's the definition of comfort food for the Swiss.

- 🍳 Cook time: ~30 minutes
- 🍽️  Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- ~150g (1/3 lb) bacon cubes
- 3 onions (medium size)
- 400g (15 oz) potatoes (firm/waxy)
- 1 - 2L (1/4 - 1/2 gal) milk
- 400g (15 oz) macaroni (dry weight)
- ~150g (1/3 lb) medium soft cheese. Appenzeller works best. Gruyère would be my go-to alternative.
- a jar of apple sauce

Feel free to vary these amounts, it's not like this is anything strict.

## Directions

1. Fry bacon cubes in pot (this pot will be used for everything so choose an appropriately large one).
2. Cut onions into half-rings and let them sweat in the same pot. Add some butter if your bacon was not fatty enough.
3. Peel potatoes and cut them into ~1 cm/half inch cubes.
4. When the onions have become sufficiently cooked, add potatoes.
5. Top everything with milk and let the potatoes cook for about 10 minutes.
7. Add macaroni and the remaining milk to cover everything. Most of the milk will be absorbed by the macaroni.
8. Shred your cheese.
9. A minute or two before the macaroni are done, add the shredded cheese into the pot. It should appear a bit too runny in the pot. While cooling it will increase in viscosity quite a bit. If the final texture is not creamy enough, it is most likely due to using the wrong cheese.
10. Season to taste. (Needs quite a bit of salt). Nutmeg also works well here.
11. Serve with apple sauce. Should be eaten together, not as a dessert.
